#Duplicate a Record

Duplicate feature helps you to copy values of existing document into new document.

####Scenario

An electronic supplier receives a repeat order from an existing customer. Since new order will have details just like previous order, you should open previous order, and Duplciate it to create new order faster. On Duplicating, values of the previous transaction will be updated in a new document. You can make changes where needed and submit the document.

You will find Copy option under:

`Menu > Copy`
