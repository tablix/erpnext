When an Employee applies for the Leave, then days mentioned in the Holiday List will not be counted, as they are holiday already. For more configuration option in Holiday List, check `HR > HR Settings`.

> Note 1: If you have specified a Holiday List in the Employment master, then that Holiday List will give priority the default Holiday List of the company.

> Note 2: You can form as many holiday lists as you wish. For example, if you have a factory, you can have one list for the factory workers and another list for office staff. You can manage between lists by attaching their respective holiday list to their respective employment detail form.

> Note 1: If you have selected a holiday list in the Employment Details form,
the system will give priority to the form mentioned here. It will fetch the
list mentioned in the form rather than the one which you may have specified as
Default; However, if there is no list in the employment details form, the
default list will be fetched.

have a mill, you can have one list for mill workers and another list for
office staff. You can manage between lists by attaching their respective
holiday list to their respective employment detail form.
