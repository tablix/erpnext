# Add Products To Website

### Add Products to the Website

ERPNext will populate your website with products out of your Item Master. The html code will be
generated automatically.

#### Step 1: Edit Item

For this example we will add a rocking chair to our catalog to sell on our website.

To edit a catalog item go to: `Stock > Items and Pricing > Item`.  From there select an item to add to website or create a new item by clicking the **New** button in the upper right.

For this example, click on the **New** button to create a new item.  Fill in the form and then click **Save**.

The page name will be generated automatically. Mention the Item-Group under
which the Item will be displayed.

#### Item Groups

Mention the Item Group under this column. If you wish to list your Item under
the broad category products, name your Item Group as Products. In case you
have various varieties of Item and want to classify them under different
names, make Item Groups with those names and check the box that says 'show in
Website'. For Example, if you wish to create a category called 'Bags', create
a Item Group named Bags.

![Item Group]({{docs_base_url}}/assets/old_images/erpnext/itemgroup-webimage-bags.png)

Once the Item Group is created go to the Website Settings page under Website.
Enter the Label, Url, and Parent Label.

Add more Items under a particular Item Group.

To add more Items under a certain Label, mention the Item Group on the Item
Page. The Items will be added automatically on the Webpage, under the Item
Group Label. For Example, To add Item-Kiddies Bag and Butterfly Print Bag,
check the 'Show in Website'box. The Items will be placed under the Label Bags
on the Webpage.
