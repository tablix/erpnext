#Increase Max Attachments

In ERPNext, you can limit how many files can be attached to specific Document. Using Custmize Form, you can set **Max(imum) Attachments** which can be added to a particular documents.

Let's assume we need to update Max Attachment for Quotation to five.

#### Step 3: Set Limit

Set Maximum Attachments as five.

<<<<<<< HEAD
<img alt="Set Max Attachment" class="screenshot" src="/docs/assets/img/articles/max-attachment-2.png">

After update Max Attachments, Update Customization Form. Reload your ERPNext account and then check specific Quotation to confirm if Max Attachment limit is applied.
